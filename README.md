# News App
This is a news app where 4 different categories of live news are displayed. The data is sourced from [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/).
This demonsrates the basic usage of `TabLayout` with `ViewPager2`. The code also illustrates how to fetch data from the internet source via API without using any third-party librarly. 

This was developed as part of Android Basics Nanodegree by Google at Udacity.
